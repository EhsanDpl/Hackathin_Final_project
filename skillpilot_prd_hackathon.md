# SkillPilot AI 

## About

SkillPilot AI is an **AI-powered Learning & Growth Platform** designed for software engineering teams. It replaces static Excel-based growth plans with **personalized learning paths**, **AI-generated content**, **daily micro‑missions**, and **progress dashboards**.

## Hackathon Goals

During the hackathon, teams will build a working **MVP** that demonstrates:
- Personalized learning : Generates personalized learning journeys for engineers
- AI‑generated learning content : Uses AI to create content, quizzes, missions, and summaries
- Track learner progress over time
- Gamified micro‑learning : Makes learning engaging through gamification
- Dashboards for learners and managers to gives visibility into team growth

Your MVP should show **how AI can transform the learning experience** inside a software development company.\

_Teams may innovate further, creativity is encouraged._
